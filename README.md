## A crafting materials and trade skills tracker for Amazon's MMORPG New World.

### I came up with this idea to ease the pains of keeping track of everything in game as heavily!

Since there is no official API yet for New World, this tracker / manager allows users to input their crafting materials, the quantity, and the location of the item in order to keep track of everything more easily. The materials table can be filtered in several ways (alphabetically, quantity, location, etc.)

### The trade skills tracker simply keeps track of all of a user's trade skills
The tracker shows progress bars, similiar to the in-game tracker, which represent the user's skill level in each of the trade skills in-game.
